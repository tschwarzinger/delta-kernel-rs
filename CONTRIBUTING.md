## How to Contribute

For trivial fixes, etc. please feel free to open a PR directly (Please see [Getting you PR
reviewed](#getting-your-pr-reviewed) below). For larger changes, we follow a structured contribution
process to ensure high-quality code:

1. **Start with an issue and/or design sketch**: Open an issue describing what you want to
   contribute and why. Continue to step 2 after reaching some consensus. This helps us avoid wasted
   effort (perhaps you were building something that someone else was already pursuing or already
   explored and rejected). Including a design sketch will help drive consensus (often a simple
   diagram or bullet points outlining high-level changes is sufficient).
2. **Prototype/POC**: Create a PR marked as prototype/draft (not intended to merge) and gather
   feedback to further de-risk the design. This PR is not intended to be merged but will guide the
   implementation and serve as a proving ground for the design. Then, pieces are torn out into
   smaller PRs that can be merged.
3. **Implementation**: Finally, create PR(s) to implement the feature (production code, tests,
   thorough docs, etc.). Often the initial POC will be split into multiple smaller PRs (e.g.,
   refactors, then feature additions, then public APIs specifically). Care should be taken to ensure
   each PR is easily review-able and thoroughly tested.

## Getting your PR reviewed

We invite everyone who would like their PRs reviewed to review _other_ open PRs as
well. Like most open source projects, our review bandwidth is limited, and help from users is
greatly appreciated. This helps increase the overall review rate, and allows contributors to build
credibility within the project.

PRs from contributors who do not review others' work will be lower priority, though we do try to
review all PRs as promptly as possible.

We also encourage contributors to optimize their PRs for review:
- A crisp and complete PR description that explains clearly what the change is for cross-checking
  against the code.
- Tightly-scoped. That is, don't mix multiple changes in a single PR.
- Code structure and doc comments optimized for understandability (e.g. avoid bloat, redundancy, and
convoluted control flow).

PRs that do not follow these principles are much more time consuming to review, and less likely to
get prompt reviews.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

We welcome contributors who use AI coding tools, but all contributions must reflect genuine
understanding of the changes being made. Please read our [AI Policy](AI_POLICY.md) before
submitting a PR.

## Forking and Setup

1. Fork the repository into your account
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/delta-kernel-rs.git
   cd delta-kernel-rs
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:delta-io/delta-kernel-rs.git
   ```

Now you have:
- `origin` pointing to your fork
- `upstream` pointing to the original repository

## Development Workflow

Our trunk branch is named `main`. Here's the typical workflow:

1. Pull the latest main to get a fresh checkout:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```
2. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
   (NB: Consider using `git worktrees` for managing multiple branches!)
3. Make your changes and test them locally. See our CI runs for a full set of tests.
   ```bash
   # run most of our tests, typically sufficient for quick iteration
   cargo test
   # run clippy
   cargo clippy --all-features --tests --benches -- -D warnings
   # build docs
   cargo doc --workspace --all-features
   # highly recommend editor that automatically formats, but in case you need to:
   cargo +nightly fmt

   # run more tests
   cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --skip read_table_version_hdfs

   # see ffi/ dir for more about testing FFI specifically
   ```
4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature
   ```
5. Open a PR from `origin/my-feature` to `upstream/main`
6. Celebrate! 🎉

**Note**: Our CI runs all tests and clippy checks. Warnings will cause CI to fail.

**Note**: We require two approvals from code owners for any PR to be merged.

## Pull Request Best Practices

#### General Tips

1. When making your first PR, please read our contributor guidelines: https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-kernel-rs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Run `cargo t --all-features --all-targets` to get started testing, and run `cargo +nightly fmt`.
3. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR.
4. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP] Your PR title ...'.
5. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.

#### PR Title Formatting

This project uses conventional commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

Each PR corresponds to a commit on the `main` branch, with the title of the PR (typically) being
used for the commit message on main. In order to ensure proper formatting in the CHANGELOG please
ensure your PR title adheres to the conventional commit specification.

Examples:
- new feature PR: "feat: new API for snapshot.update()"
- bugfix PR: "fix: correctly apply DV in read-table example"

#### PR Testing

Please make sure to add test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.
If it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested, ideally via a reproducible test documented in the PR description.
