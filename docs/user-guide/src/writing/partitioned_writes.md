# Writing to partitioned tables

To write data to a partitioned table, you create a `BoundWriteContext` for each distinct
set of partition values, write Parquet files through the engine for each one, and
commit. Kernel validates partition values, serializes them per the Delta protocol,
and constructs the correct directory paths.

Before reading this page, make sure you understand
[Appending Data](./append.md) and
[Creating a Table](./create_table.md#partitioned-tables).

## How partitioned writes differ

For unpartitioned tables, you create one `BoundWriteContext` and write all data through it.
For partitioned tables, you create one `BoundWriteContext` per distinct partition value
combination. Partition values are file-constant metadata baked into the `BoundWriteContext`
at creation time, not data columns passed at write time.

```text
Unpartitioned:  1 BoundWriteContext  -->  write all data
Partitioned:    1 BoundWriteContext per distinct partition  -->  write that partition's data
```

## The write flow

The pattern for partitioned writes is: **group your data by partition values, create a
`BoundWriteContext` per group, and write each group**.

```rust,no_run
# extern crate delta_kernel;
# extern crate delta_kernel_default_engine;
# extern crate tokio;
# use std::collections::HashMap;
# use delta_kernel::arrow::array::RecordBatch;
# use delta_kernel::committer::FileSystemCommitter;
# use delta_kernel::engine::arrow_data::ArrowEngineData;
# use delta_kernel_default_engine::DefaultEngine;
# use delta_kernel_default_engine::storage::store_from_url;
# use delta_kernel::expressions::Scalar;
# use delta_kernel::{Result, Snapshot};
# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() -> Result<()> {
# let url = delta_kernel::try_parse_uri("/tmp/partitioned_table")?;
# let engine = DefaultEngine::builder(store_from_url(&url)?).build();
let snapshot = Snapshot::builder_for(url).build(&engine)?;
let mut txn = snapshot
    .transaction(Box::new(FileSystemCommitter::new()), &engine)?
    .with_operation("INSERT".to_string())
    .with_data_change(true);

// Build the write state before iterating over partitions.
let write_state = txn.write_state()?;

// Suppose you have data grouped by partition values already.
let partitions: Vec<(HashMap<String, Scalar>, RecordBatch)> = todo!("group your data");

for (partition_values, batch) in partitions {
    // 1. Create a BoundWriteContext for this partition
    let wc = write_state
        .write_context_builder()
        .with_partition_values(partition_values)
        .build()?;

    // 2. Write the data (the logical write schema excludes partition columns)
    let data = ArrowEngineData::new(batch);
    let file_metadata = engine.write_parquet(&data, &wc).await?;

    // 3. Register the written file
    txn.add_files(file_metadata);
}

// Commit all partitions in a single transaction
txn.commit(&engine)?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Each builder can take a `HashMap<String, Scalar>` mapping logical partition column names to typed
values:

```rust,ignore
let partition_values = HashMap::from([
    ("year".to_string(), Scalar::Integer(2024)),
    ("month".to_string(), Scalar::Integer(3)),
]);
let wc = write_state
    .write_context_builder()
    .with_partition_values(partition_values)
    .build()?;
```

For distributed writes, encode the state on the coordinator and decode it on each worker before
binding that worker's partition values. The transport representation only supports the same
delta-kernel version on both sides.

```rust,ignore
// Coordinator
let encoded = txn.write_state()?.encode()?;
send_to_workers(encoded);

// Worker
let write_state = WriteState::decode(&encoded)?;
let wc = write_state
    .write_context_builder()
    .with_partition_values(partition_values)
    .build()?;
```

Key points:

- **Typed values**: partition values are `Scalar` values, not strings. Pass
  `Scalar::Integer(2024)` for an integer column, not `Scalar::String("2024".into())`.
  Kernel rejects type mismatches.
- **Case-insensitive keys**: `"YEAR"` matches schema column `"year"`. Kernel normalizes
  to the schema case.
- **No partition columns in your logical data**: your data batches should follow the logical write
  schema (`wc.logical_data_schema()`), which excludes partition columns.
- **Materialization is automatic**: some table features (such as
  `materializePartitionColumns` and `icebergCompatV3`) require partition values to also be
  written into the data files as regular columns. Kernel handles this through the
  logical-to-physical expression.

> [!TIP]
> To get the partition column names at runtime, call `txn.logical_partition_columns()`.
> This is useful when your connector handles arbitrary tables and does not know the
> partition columns in advance.

## Grouping data by partition values

How you group data by partition values is up to your connector. Kernel's contract is
that each write-context builder receives a `HashMap<String, Scalar>` for one distinct partition,
and the corresponding data files contain only that partition's rows.

Kernel provides `serialize_partition_value` as a public utility for building hashable
group keys from `Scalar` values. It returns a `Result<Option<String>>` per value,
which you can collect into a `Vec<Option<String>>` group key for use in a `HashMap`.

## Partition value validation

`BoundWriteContextBuilder::build` validates the provided values before creating the
`BoundWriteContext`:

| Check | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Missing partition column | Table has `["year", "month"]` but only `"year"` provided |
| Extra key | `"region"` provided but is not a partition column |
| Type mismatch | `Scalar::String("2024")` for an `INTEGER` column |
| Duplicate after case normalization | Both `"YEAR"` and `"year"` provided |

If validation fails, `build` returns an error before any data reaches disk.

## What Kernel handles

When you build a partitioned write context, Kernel performs the following steps internally. Your
connector does not need to implement any of this:

1. **Key validation**: all partition columns present, no extra keys
2. **Case normalization**: keys matched case-insensitively against the schema
3. **Type checking**: each `Scalar`'s type must match the partition column's schema type
4. **Value serialization**: `Scalar` values converted to protocol-compliant strings
   (for example, `Scalar::Date(19723)` becomes `"2024-01-01"`)
5. **Key translation**: logical column names translated to physical names when
   column mapping is enabled

`write_dir()` on the resulting `BoundWriteContext` returns the directory where data files
should be written. Without column mapping, this is a Hive-style path like
`<table_root>/year=2024/month=3/`. With column mapping enabled, this is a
random two-character prefix directory like `<table_root>/aB/` that avoids
exposing physical column names and distributes files across object store
prefixes to prevent S3 hotspots.

> [!NOTE]

> on-disk layout produced by Delta-Spark and Delta-Kernel-Java. For example, a partition

> URI-encoded to `%25`). The same encoded path is recorded in the `add.path` field of the
