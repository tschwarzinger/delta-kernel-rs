# Appending Data

To append data to an existing Delta table, you create a `Transaction` from a
[Snapshot](../concepts/architecture.md#snapshot), write Parquet files through the engine, register them,
and commit. For a quick end-to-end example that creates a table and writes data, see
[Quick Start: Writing a Table](../getting_started/quick_start_write.md).

## The write flow

Appending data to a Delta table follows these steps:

1. Get a `Snapshot` of the table
2. Create a `Transaction` from the snapshot
3. Create a `WriteState` and bind a `BoundWriteContext`
4. [Write Parquet files](#writing-parquet-files) using the engine and `BoundWriteContext`
5. Register the written files with the transaction via `add_files`
6. Commit the transaction

The following example assumes you already have an `engine: DefaultEngine`, which provides
an async `write_parquet` helper. If you use a custom `Engine`, the step 4
may differ.

```rust,no_run
# extern crate delta_kernel;
# extern crate delta_kernel_default_engine;
# extern crate tokio;
# use std::sync::Arc;
# use delta_kernel::arrow::array::{Int32Array, RecordBatch, StringArray};
# use delta_kernel::committer::FileSystemCommitter;
# use delta_kernel::engine::arrow_conversion::TryIntoArrow;
# use delta_kernel::engine::arrow_data::ArrowEngineData;
# use delta_kernel_default_engine::DefaultEngine;
# use delta_kernel_default_engine::storage::store_from_url;
# use delta_kernel::transaction::CommitResult;
# use delta_kernel::{Result, Snapshot};
# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() -> Result<()> {
# let url = delta_kernel::try_parse_uri("/tmp/table")?;
# let engine = DefaultEngine::builder(store_from_url(&url)?).build();
// 1. Get a snapshot
let snapshot = Snapshot::builder_for(url).build(&engine)?;

// 2. Create a transaction
let mut txn = snapshot
    .transaction(Box::new(FileSystemCommitter::new()), &engine)?
    .with_operation("INSERT".to_string())
    .with_engine_info("my-app/1.0")
    .with_data_change(true);

// 3. Create write state and bind a write context
let write_state = txn.write_state()?;
let write_context = write_state.write_context_builder().build()?;

// 4. Write Parquet file(s)
// Assumes the table schema is: name (STRING), age (INTEGER), city (STRING)
let batch = RecordBatch::try_new(
    Arc::new(
        write_context
            .logical_data_schema()
            .as_ref()
            .try_into_arrow()?,
    ),
    vec![
        Arc::new(StringArray::from(vec!["Dave", "Eve", "Frank"])),
        Arc::new(Int32Array::from(vec![4, 5, 6])),
        Arc::new(StringArray::from(vec!["Austin", "Boston", "Chicago"])),
    ],
)?;
let data = ArrowEngineData::new(batch);
let file_metadata = engine
    .write_parquet(&data, &write_context)
    .await?;

// 5. Register the files
txn.add_files(file_metadata);

// 6. Commit
match txn.commit(&engine)? {
    CommitResult::Committed(committed) => {
        println!("Committed version {}", committed.commit_version());
    }
    _ => eprintln!("commit did not succeed"),
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Creating a transaction

A transaction is created from a snapshot. The snapshot pins the table version you are
writing against:

```rust,ignore
let mut txn = snapshot
    .transaction(Box::new(FileSystemCommitter::new()), &engine)?
    .with_operation("INSERT".to_string())
    .with_engine_info("my-app/1.0")
    .with_data_change(true);
```

The builder methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `with_operation(String)` | Operation name stored in the commit log (e.g. `"INSERT"`, `"MERGE"`) |
| `with_engine_info(impl Into<String>)` | Identifies your application in the commit log |
| `with_data_change(bool)` | Whether this commit materially changes data (`true`) or just reorganizes it (`false`, e.g. OPTIMIZE) |

## WriteState and BoundWriteContext

If the table declares column defaults, resolve any defaults your input needs and acknowledge them
before requesting write state. See [Column defaults](./column_defaults.md) for both Kernel-parsed
and connector-evaluated defaults.

Before writing data, obtain a `WriteState` from the transaction. Bind the state to create a
`BoundWriteContext`, which bundles everything needed to correctly write Parquet files:

```rust,ignore
let write_state = txn.write_state()?;

// For unpartitioned tables
let write_context = write_state.write_context_builder().build()?;

// For partitioned tables, pass the partition values for this file
let write_context = write_state
    .write_context_builder()
    .with_partition_values(partition_values)
    .build()?;
```

If the connector input data contains materialized Row IDs or Row Commit Versions, provide their
logical column names to the builder:

```rust,ignore
use delta_kernel::transaction::RowTrackingMetadataColumns;

let write_context = write_state
    .write_context_builder()
    .with_row_tracking_columns(RowTrackingMetadataColumns {
        row_id_col_name: Some("row_id"),
        row_commit_version_col_name: Some("row_commit_version"),
    })
    .build()?;
```

Kernel maps each provided logical row-tracking metadata column to the corresponding physical
column configured on the table. Row Tracking must be enabled when these options are provided.

For partitioned tables, see
[Writing to Partitioned Tables](./partitioned_writes.md).

`BoundWriteContext` provides:

| Method | Returns | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `table_root_dir()` | `&Url` | The table root URL |
| `write_dir()` | `Url` | The URL for writing files |
| `logical_data_schema()` | `&SchemaRef` | The schema your connector input data must conform to when using this write context |
| `physical_data_schema()` | `&SchemaRef` | The schema for the data written to Parquet |
| `logical_to_physical()` | `ExpressionRef` | Expression that transforms logical data to physical |
| `column_mapping_mode()` | `ColumnMappingMode` | The column mapping mode for this table |
| `stats_columns()` | `&[ColumnName]` | Columns that should have statistics collected |
| `physical_partition_values()` | `&HashMap<String, Option<String>>` | Serialized partition values keyed by physical column name |

## Writing Parquet files

Start with the logical `data: EngineData` you want to write. Its schema should conform to
`write_context.logical_data_schema()`.

### Using `DefaultEngine`

The `DefaultEngine` provides an async helper that does everything for you:

```rust,ignore
let file_metadata = engine
    .write_parquet(&data, &write_context)
    .await?;
```

- **`data`**: An `ArrowEngineData` wrapping a `RecordBatch` matching the logical schema
- **`write_context`**: Built from a `WriteState` with `write_context_builder()`

`DefaultEngine::write_parquet` handles the logical-to-physical transformation, generates a unique filename,
writes the file, collects statistics, and returns file metadata that you pass to
`txn.add_files()`.

### Using a custom engine

If you do not use `DefaultEngine`, write the files yourself. The expected flow is:

1. Evaluate `write_context.logical_to_physical()` to transform your logical data into
   physical data.
2. Write the physical data under `write_context.write_dir()`, then pass the corresponding
   add-file metadata to `txn.add_files()`.

```rust,ignore
// Assume: data: Box<dyn EngineData> (logical), engine: impl Engine,
// write_context: BoundWriteContext.

// 1. Transform logical data into physical data
let evaluator = engine.evaluation_handler().new_expression_evaluator(
    write_context.logical_data_schema().clone(),
    write_context.logical_to_physical(),
    write_context.physical_data_schema().clone().into(),
)?;
let physical_data = evaluator.evaluate(data.as_ref())?;

// 2. Write `physical_data` under `write_context.write_dir()` in whatever way your
// engine writes Parquet, producing `add_file_metadata` for the written file.

txn.add_files(add_file_metadata);
```

You can call `add_files` multiple times to write multiple files in one transaction.

> [!NOTE]
> Transaction methods that prepare or register data files (`write_state`, `add_files`, and
> `stats_schema`) are gated by the `SupportsDataFiles` trait bound. They're available on standard
> write transactions but not on metadata-only transaction states such as `AlterTable`.

## Committing

`commit()` consumes the transaction and returns a `CommitResult`:

```rust,ignore
match txn.commit(&engine)? {
    CommitResult::Committed(committed) => {
        println!("Committed version {}", committed.commit_version());
    }
    _ => {
        eprintln!("commit did not succeed");
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `commit()` returns a `CommitResult` with three variants: `Committed` on success, `Conflicted` if
> another writer committed first, and `Retryable` for transient IO errors. Automatic conflict
> resolution is not yet supported. A blind append to a table with no concurrent writers always
> succeeds.

## Blind appends

A **blind append** is a write that adds new files without reading or depending on existing
table state. To mark a transaction as a blind append, call `with_blind_append()` during
construction:

```rust,ignore
let txn = snapshot
    .transaction(Box::new(FileSystemCommitter::new()), &engine)?
    .with_operation("INSERT".to_string())
    .with_blind_append();
```

Kernel records `isBlindAppend: true` in the commit's `commitInfo` action. This flag
enables conflict resolution optimizations: two blind appends to the same table can never
conflict with each other, because neither depends on the other's output.

Kernel validates the following rules at commit time. If any rule is violated, `commit()`
returns an error:

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| The transaction must add at least one file | A blind append with no data is meaningless |
| `data_change` must be `true` | Blind appends are logical data additions, not reorganizations |
| The transaction must not remove any files | Removing files means the write depends on existing state |
| The transaction must not update deletion vectors | Deletion vector updates depend on existing state |
| The transaction must not be a create-table transaction | Table creation is not an append |

> [!TIP]
> Mark your transaction as a blind append whenever you are inserting new data without reading
> the table first. This gives the committer the information it needs to resolve conflicts
> safely in multi-writer scenarios.

## Custom commit info

Kernel always writes a `commitInfo` action for every commit. To include your own fields in
that action, call `with_commit_info()` with your custom data and its schema:

```rust,ignore
let txn = snapshot
    .transaction(Box::new(FileSystemCommitter::new()), &engine)?
    .with_operation("INSERT".to_string())
    .with_operation_parameters([("mode", Some("Append")), ("predicate", None)])
    .with_operation_metrics([("numFiles", Some("1"))])
    .with_commit_info(engine_commit_info, commit_info_schema);
```

The `engine_commit_info` argument is a `Box<dyn EngineData>` containing the fields you want
to add, and `commit_info_schema` is the corresponding `SchemaRef`. Kernel merges your fields
into the final `commitInfo` action.

Kernel reserves certain fields and overrides them regardless of what you provide. Do not set
these fields in your custom commit info:

| Field | Meaning | Value written by Kernel |
|-------|---------|-------------------------|
| `timestamp` | The transaction's commit timestamp | Current time when the transaction is created |
| `inCommitTimestamp` | The table's in-commit timestamp | The in-commit timestamp when enabled; omitted otherwise |
| `operation` | The operation name | The value from `with_operation()`; defaults to `UNKNOWN` for existing-table transactions and is fixed for create and alter transactions |
| `operationParameters` | Parameters describing the operation | The value from `with_operation_parameters()`; defaults to `{}` |
| `operationMetrics` | Metrics recorded for the operation | The value from `with_operation_metrics()`; omitted when unset, while an explicitly empty map is written as `{}` |
| `kernelVersion` | The Kernel library version | Current Kernel version |
| `isBlindAppend` | Whether the commit is a blind append | `true` after `with_blind_append()`; omitted (`false`) otherwise |
| `engineInfo` | The engine identifier | The value from `with_engine_info()`; omitted for existing and alter transactions when unset, while create uses its required engine identifier |
| `txnId` | A unique transaction identifier | A new UUID generated for the commit |

Kernel ignores reserved fields in custom commit info. Use `with_operation_parameters()` and
`with_operation_metrics()` to set those fields. Each setter replaces the complete map. A `None`
value is written as `null`. If a key appears more than once, the last value wins. Fields with names
that do not collide are preserved as-is.

## After committing

A successful commit returns a `CommittedTransaction` with access to a post-commit
snapshot and post-commit statistics:

```rust,ignore
let committed = match txn.commit(&engine)? {
    CommitResult::Committed(c) => c,
    _ => panic!("unexpected result"),
};

// The version that was committed
let version = committed.commit_version();

// Post-commit statistics help you decide when to run maintenance
let stats = committed.post_commit_stats();
println!("Commits since last checkpoint: {}", stats.commits_since_checkpoint);
println!("Commits since last log compaction: {}", stats.commits_since_log_compaction);

// The post-commit snapshot reflects the table state after this commit.
// Use it for maintenance operations like publishing, checkpointing, and checksums.
if let Some(snapshot) = committed.post_commit_snapshot() {
    // Write a checksum file for this version
    let (result, snapshot) = snapshot.write_checksum(&engine)?;

    // For catalog-managed tables: snapshot.publish(engine, committer)?
    // For checkpointing: snapshot.checkpoint(&engine)?
}
```

### Post-commit statistics

`CommittedTransaction::post_commit_stats()` returns a `PostCommitStats` struct with two
fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `commits_since_checkpoint` | Number of commits since the last checkpoint. Commit 0 counts as a checkpoint. |
| `commits_since_log_compaction` | Number of commits since the last log compaction or checkpoint. A checkpoint resets this counter too. |

Use these values to decide when to trigger maintenance. For example, you might checkpoint
every 10 commits or compact the log every 50 commits.

### Writing a checksum

You can call `write_checksum()` on the post-commit snapshot to write a checksum file (CRC
file), which enables faster snapshot loading and table state validation:

```rust,ignore
if let Some(snapshot) = committed.post_commit_snapshot() {
    let (checksum_result, updated_snapshot) = snapshot.write_checksum(&engine)?;
    // Use updated_snapshot for subsequent operations (it includes the new CRC file)
}
```

`write_checksum()` returns a `ChecksumWriteResult` and an updated `SnapshotRef`.
`ChecksumWriteResult::Written` means the CRC file was created successfully.
`ChecksumWriteResult::AlreadyExists` means a CRC file already exists at this version, and
the original snapshot is returned unchanged. Per the Delta protocol, writers must not
overwrite existing checksum files.

> [!NOTE]
> `write_checksum()` requires in-memory CRC information, which is only available on
> post-commit snapshots. Calling it on a snapshot loaded from disk (without a pre-computed
> CRC) returns a `ChecksumWriteUnsupported` error.

The post-commit snapshot is the entry point for maintenance operations that should happen
after a successful write. See [Checkpointing](../maintenance/checkpointing.md) and
[Catalog-Managed Tables](../catalog_managed/overview.md) for details.
