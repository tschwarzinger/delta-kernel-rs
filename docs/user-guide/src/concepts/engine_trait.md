# The Engine trait

The `Engine` trait is the integration point between Delta Kernel and your connector. Kernel
implements the Delta protocol and gives you scan and write APIs, but it needs help with the
mechanics: listing files, reading and writing JSON and Parquet, and evaluating expressions for
data skipping and logical-to-physical transformations. Kernel never does any of this directly.
Instead, it calls into the `Engine` trait, which your connector implements.

This matters because it lets Kernel stay format-agnostic and runtime-agnostic. You control
how I/O happens, what columnar format you use, and how expressions are evaluated.

A [DefaultEngine](#the-default-engine) is provided that you can use out of the box. If you
need better performance or want to use your own data formats, you can build a custom engine.
See [Building a Connector](../connector/overview.md) for details.

## The trait

```rust,ignore
trait Engine: AsAny {
    fn evaluation_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn EvaluationHandler>;
    fn storage_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn StorageHandler>;
    fn json_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn JsonHandler>;
    fn parquet_handler(&self) -> Arc<dyn ParquetHandler>;
}
```

Kernel calls these methods whenever it needs to interact with the outside world. Each returns
a handler trait object that Kernel uses for a specific category of work. The four handlers
cover storage, JSON, Parquet, and expression evaluation. For observability, see
[Observability](../observability/observability.md).

## The four handlers

### StorageHandler

File system operations. Kernel calls this to list and read files from the Delta log, and to
write commit and checkpoint files.

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `list_from(path)` | List files lexicographically after `path` in the same directory |
| `read_files(files)` | Read byte ranges from one or more files |
| `copy_atomic(src, dst)` | Atomically copy a file (used for publishing commits) |
| `put(path, data, overwrite)` | Write raw bytes to a path (fails if `overwrite` is false and file exists) |
| `head(path)` | Get file metadata (size, modification time) without reading content |

Storage listing and byte reads also have cancellation-aware variants described below.

### JsonHandler

Reads and writes JSON. Kernel uses this for Delta log commits (the `_delta_log/*.json`
files) and the JSON checkpoint manifest that references parquet sidecars. The sidecar
files themselves are parquet and are read by the `ParquetHandler` below.

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `parse_json(strings, schema)` | Parse JSON strings into columnar `EngineData` |
| `read_json_files(files, schema, predicate)` | Read JSON files and return `EngineData` (predicate is an optional hint) |
| `read_json_files_with_cancellation(files, schema, predicate, token)` | As above, but a cooperative engine can abandon the read when `token` fires. Optional to override — see [Cancellation](#cancellation) |
| `write_json_file(path, data, overwrite)` | Atomically write a stream of `FilteredEngineData` rows as a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per row, nulls omitted) and return its exact serialized byte size |

### ParquetHandler

Reads and writes Parquet. Kernel uses this for checkpoint files (including parquet
checkpoint sidecars) and for reading data files during scans.

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `read_parquet_files(files, schema, predicate)` | Read Parquet files into `EngineData` |
| `read_parquet_files_with_cancellation(files, schema, predicate, token)` | As above, but a cooperative engine can abandon the read when `token` fires — see [Cancellation](#cancellation) |
| `write_parquet_file(url, data)` | Write a stream of `EngineData` batches as a single Parquet file at the given URL |
| `read_parquet_footer(file)` | Read file footer metadata (schema, field IDs) without reading data |
| `read_parquet_footer_with_cancellation(file, token)` | As above, but a cooperative engine can abandon the footer read when `token` fires — see [Cancellation](#cancellation) |

The Parquet handler also supports metadata columns (row index, file path) and field-ID-based
column matching for column mapping.

### Cancellation

Reading the Delta log for a large table can touch many commit and checkpoint files, and a
connector often wants to abandon that work when the request behind it goes away — a cancelled
query, a dropped RPC, a closed session. Kernel supports this cooperatively through an optional
[`CancellationToken`] that a caller attaches to a scan (see
[Advanced reads with scan_metadata()](../reading/scan_metadata.md#cancelling-a-scan)).

Cancellation-aware handlers respond at two boundaries:

- **Before starting or pulling work.** Cancellation-aware handler methods check the token before
  starting. Their iterator-producing defaults also check before each pull, preventing new I/O from
  being triggered after cancellation.

- **In flight.** An Engine can additionally interrupt I/O already in flight. This matters when
  one request may otherwise block for a noticeable time.

These variants are optional. Their default implementations return early if the token is already
cancelled and otherwise delegate to their plain versions so that an existing handler keeps working
unchanged and simply doesn't interrupt mid-read. Cancellation can race with successful completion,
so a request already in flight may complete normally. Custom cancellation-aware handler
implementations own this behavior because Kernel does not add another polling layer around their
iterators.

For how to implement the cancellation-aware variants, see
[Implementing the Engine Trait](../connector/implementing_engine.md#cancellation-aware-reads).
The public API defines the full [Engine operation cancellation contract].

[Engine operation cancellation contract]: https://docs.rs/delta_kernel/latest/delta_kernel/cancellation/index.html#engine-operation-contract

### EvaluationHandler

Expression evaluation. Kernel uses this for data skipping (evaluating predicates against
file statistics) and for applying per-file transformations (partition value injection, column
mapping).

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `new_expression_evaluator(schema, expr, output_type)` | Create a reusable evaluator for an expression |
| `new_predicate_evaluator(schema, predicate)` | Create a reusable evaluator for a boolean predicate |
| `create_many(schema, rows)` | Create a multi-row `EngineData` from scalar values |

The expression and predicate evaluators are reusable objects that you can call repeatedly on
different batches of `EngineData`.

## The Default Engine

The `DefaultEngine` is a batteries-included implementation that works out of the box:

- Uses **Apache Arrow** as the in-memory data format
- Uses **`object_store`** for I/O (supports local FS, S3, GCS, Azure)
- Runs async I/O on a **Tokio** thread pool
- Supports multiple Arrow versions (see [Feature Flags](./feature_flags.md))

To construct one, create an object store and pass it to the builder:

```rust,no_run
# extern crate delta_kernel;
# extern crate delta_kernel_default_engine;
# extern crate url;
# use delta_kernel_default_engine::DefaultEngine;
# use delta_kernel_default_engine::storage::store_from_url;
# use delta_kernel::Result;
# fn example() -> Result<()> {
let url = url::Url::parse("file:///path/to/table")?;
let store = store_from_url(&url)?;
let engine = DefaultEngine::builder(store).build();
# Ok(())
# }
```

`DefaultEngine` also provides a convenience method for writing Parquet files:

```rust,ignore
let engine_data = engine
    .write_parquet(&data, &write_context)
    .await?;
```

This is not part of the `Engine` trait itself. It's a helper on `DefaultEngine` that
orchestrates the lower-level `ParquetHandler` methods with a `BoundWriteContext` (write directory,
schema, stats columns, partition values).

## Configuring the Default Engine

`DefaultEngine` uses a builder pattern that lets you customize the task executor and plug in a
metrics reporter. The builder starts from `DefaultEngine::builder(store)` and chains optional
configuration before calling `build()`:

```rust,ignore
let engine = DefaultEngine::builder(store)
    .with_metrics_reporter(reporter)
    .with_task_executor(executor)
    .build();
```

All builder methods are optional. Calling `DefaultEngine::builder(store).build()` gives you a
fully functional engine with sensible defaults.

### The TaskExecutor trait

`DefaultEngine` uses asynchronous I/O internally, but Kernel's public APIs are synchronous.
The `TaskExecutor` trait bridges this gap by defining how async work gets scheduled and
awaited. It has four methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `block_on(future)` | Run an async future to completion and return the result. Must not panic when called inside an async context. |
| `spawn(future)` | Run a future in the background without waiting for its result. |
| `spawn_blocking(closure)` | Run a blocking closure on a thread where blocking is safe, returning a future of the result. |
| `enter()` | Enter the executor's runtime context, returning a guard. While the guard is held, `tokio::runtime::Handle::current()` resolves to the executor's runtime. |

You don't need to implement `TaskExecutor` yourself unless you have a non-Tokio async runtime.
Kernel ships two Tokio-based implementations behind the `tokio` feature flag.

### TokioBackgroundExecutor

`TokioBackgroundExecutor` is the default executor. It spawns a **dedicated background thread**
running a single-threaded Tokio runtime. All async work is dispatched to that thread over a
channel.

```rust,ignore
use delta_kernel_default_engine::executor::tokio::TokioBackgroundExecutor;

let executor = TokioBackgroundExecutor::new();
```

This is the right choice when:

- You don't already have a Tokio runtime in your application.
- You want Kernel's I/O isolated from the rest of your process.
- You're building a standalone connector or CLI tool.

Because it owns its runtime, `TokioBackgroundExecutor` works even when no external Tokio
runtime is active. On drop, it shuts down the background thread cleanly.

### TokioMultiThreadExecutor

`TokioMultiThreadExecutor` runs async work on a multi-threaded Tokio runtime. It comes in two
flavors.

**Share an existing runtime.** If your application already has a Tokio runtime (for example,
a web server or a query engine), pass its handle so Kernel's I/O shares the same thread pool:

```rust,ignore
use delta_kernel_default_engine::executor::tokio::TokioMultiThreadExecutor;

let handle = tokio::runtime::Handle::current();
let executor = TokioMultiThreadExecutor::new(handle);
```

The handle must come from a multi-threaded runtime. Passing a current-thread handle causes a
panic.

**Own a dedicated runtime.** If you want a multi-threaded runtime that Kernel manages, use
`new_owned_runtime`. You can optionally set the number of worker threads and the maximum number
of blocking threads. Pass `None` for either to use Tokio's defaults:

```rust,ignore
let executor = TokioMultiThreadExecutor::new_owned_runtime(
    Some(4),   // 4 worker threads
    Some(64),  // up to 64 blocking threads
)?;
```

> [!WARNING]
> Deeply nested `block_on` calls can exhaust Tokio's blocking thread pool and deadlock. If you
> set a small `max_blocking_threads`, keep nesting depth low.

### Choosing an executor

| Scenario | Executor |
|----------|----------|
| No existing Tokio runtime | `TokioBackgroundExecutor` (the default) |
| You have an existing multi-threaded Tokio runtime you want to share | `TokioMultiThreadExecutor::new(handle)` |
| You want a dedicated multi-threaded pool with custom sizing | `TokioMultiThreadExecutor::new_owned_runtime(workers, blocking)` |
| You need to isolate Kernel I/O from other async work | `TokioBackgroundExecutor` |

To use a custom executor, pass it to the builder with `with_task_executor`:

```rust,ignore
let executor = Arc::new(TokioMultiThreadExecutor::new(handle));
let engine = DefaultEngine::builder(store)
    .with_task_executor(executor)
    .build();
```

### Entering the runtime context

Some libraries (for example, `object_store` or `reqwest`) require an active Tokio runtime
context to construct clients or resolve configuration. If you call such code outside of an
async function, `tokio::runtime::Handle::current()` will panic because no runtime is active.

`DefaultEngine::enter()` solves this by entering the executor's runtime context:

```rust,ignore
let guard = engine.enter();
// Code here can call Handle::current() safely.
// The guard must be dropped before acquiring another.
drop(guard);
```

The returned guard keeps the runtime context active until it is dropped. If you acquire
multiple guards, you must drop them in reverse order. Dropping out of order causes a panic.

## When to implement your own Engine

You should implement `Engine` if:

- You have your own columnar data format (not Arrow)
- You need custom I/O (e.g. your own distributed file system client)
- You want to use your own expression evaluation engine
- You need to control parallelism or resource usage beyond what `DefaultEngine` offers

You do **not** need a custom engine to use different storage (S3, Azure, etc.). The
`DefaultEngine` supports all `object_store` backends. See
[Configuring Storage](../storage/configuring_storage.md).
