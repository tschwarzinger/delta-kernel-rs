# Architecture

## Layered Design

```
Compute Engine (Spark, Flink, DuckDB, Polars, ...)
  -> Your Delta Connector (implements compute engine's DataSource API)
    -> Delta Kernel (snapshot loading, scan orchestration, write transaction coordination,
       log replay, data skipping, schema enforcement, predicate evaluation,
       physical-to-logical transforms, deletion vector handling, checkpointing)
      -> Engine trait (abstraction for I/O and compute)
        -> DefaultEngine (Arrow + object_store + Tokio) or custom engine
          -> Storage (local FS, S3, GCS, Azure, HDFS, ...)
```

Kernel handles the Delta protocol; connectors handle execution, distribution, and data flow.
Kernel never does I/O directly: it delegates all I/O to the Engine trait. Kernel also leaves
columnar memory representation and I/O scheduling to the connector and engine. For example, during
log replay or checkpoint writes, kernel receives opaque `EngineData` batches, inspects them via the
visitor pattern, updates a selection vector, and hands them back to the engine: it never
deserializes the full batch into in-memory structs.

## Snapshot

`Snapshot` (`kernel/src/snapshot/`) is the primary entry point for operations on an existing table.
It is an immutable point-in-time view of a Delta table at a specific version, providing the table
schema, metadata, properties, and version number.

Built via `Snapshot::builder_for(url).build(engine)` (latest version) or
`.at_version(v).build(engine)` (specific version). For catalog-managed tables,
`.with_log_tail(commits)` supplies recent unpublished commits from the catalog and
`.with_max_catalog_version(v)` caps the snapshot at the latest catalog-ratified version.
`Snapshot::builder_from(snapshot)` returns an `IncrementalSnapshotBuilder` that reuses the input
snapshot. Its opt-in `skip_new_checkpoints()` mode keeps the input checkpoint and every commit in
the update window so a snapshot-derived `CommitRange` can inspect them without another log
listing.
Under `internal-api`, `.with_snapshot_hint(hint)` constructs a snapshot without engine log I/O.
Kernel validates structural consistency; the connector owns table-root membership,
protocol/metadata provenance, `max_published_version`, and freshness.

**Snapshot loading internals:**
1. Ordinary builds discover commits and checkpoints through **LogSegment**
   (`kernel/src/log_segment/`) and resolve Protocol and Metadata through CRC state or log replay.
   Domain metadata is resolved lazily from CRC state or log replay when queried. Snapshot-hint
   builds validate and assemble the supplied state instead.
2. **Log replay** (`kernel/src/log_replay/`): file-action deduplication via
   `FileActionDeduplicator` and `LogReplayProcessor` trait (distinct from Protocol/Metadata
   replay above)

From a snapshot you can: read the schema and table properties, build a `Scan` to read data,
start a `Transaction` to write data, or create a checkpoint.

## Read Path

`Snapshot` -> `ScanBuilder` -> `Scan` -> data

The scan pipeline: log replay (build active file list) -> data skipping (prune files via stats
and partition values) -> file reading -> physical-to-logical transform (partition values,
column mapping, schema evolution) -> deletion vector filtering.

**Key modules** (`kernel/src/scan/`): `log_replay.rs` (reconcile Add/Remove into active file
set), `data_skipping.rs` (rewrite predicates against min/max/nullCount stats and partition values).

**Execution paths:**
- `scan.execute(engine)`: kernel handles everything end-to-end, returns `EngineData`
- `scan.scan_metadata(engine)`: returns file list + transforms; connector reads files and
  calls `transform_to_logical` / `DvInfo::get_selection_vector`
- `scan.parallel_scan_metadata(engine)`: two-phase distributed log replay (requires the
  `internal-api` feature)

**Incremental read:** `Snapshot::incremental_scan_builder(base_version)` streams the file-action
diff over `(base_version, target_version]`: live Adds as a `FilteredEngineData` iterator
plus a terminal summary of live Add and Remove file keys. Use this to advance a cached
file listing without re-scanning the table.

## Write Path

`Snapshot` -> `Transaction` -> (`WriteState` -> `BoundWriteContextBuilder` ->
`BoundWriteContext`) -> commit

Kernel captures table-wide configuration in a transportable `WriteState`. Each writer binds
partition values and any logical materialized row-tracking columns to create a `BoundWriteContext`
containing validated partition values, data schemas, statistics columns, and the recommended write
directory. The transaction registers the resulting files, enforces protocol compliance, assembles
commit actions, and delegates the atomic commit to a `Committer`.

**Data-write steps:**
1. Create `Transaction` from a snapshot with a `Committer` (e.g. `FileSystemCommitter`)
2. Call `txn.write_state()` after configuring the transaction, then use
   `WriteState::write_context_builder()` to bind partition values and build a `BoundWriteContext`.
   Distributed writers can encode the state and decode it on each worker before binding partition
   values.
3. Write Parquet files (via engine), collect file metadata
4. Register files via `txn.add_files(metadata)` and stage any removals or deletion-vector updates
5. Commit: returns `CommitResult::Committed`, `Conflicted`, or `Retryable`

- **Transaction** (`kernel/src/transaction/`): blind append writes, file removals, deletion-vector
  updates, table creation (including clustered tables via `DataLayout`), and limited schema
  evolution
- **Committer** (`kernel/src/committer/`): commit coordination. `FileSystemCommitter` for
  filesystem tables (atomic put-if-absent to `_delta_log/`); custom `Committer` implementations
  for catalog-managed tables (staging, ratifying, publishing).

## Engine Trait System

The kernel is built around the `Engine` trait (`kernel/src/lib.rs`), which provides the required
handlers below and an optional `PlanExecutor` under the `declarative-plans` feature:

| Handler              | Purpose                          | Key Methods                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `StorageHandler`     | File system operations           | `list_from`, `read_files`, etc.            |
| `JsonHandler`        | Delta log commit parsing/writing | `parse_json`, `read_json_files`            |
| `ParquetHandler`     | Data file and checkpoint I/O     | `read_parquet_files`, `write_parquet_file`  |
| `EvaluationHandler`  | Expression/predicate evaluation  | `new_expression_evaluator`, etc.           |

Metrics are emitted as tracing events and collected by tracing layers. A `DefaultEngine` (Arrow +
`object_store` + Tokio) lives in `default-engine/src/`. Custom engines only need to replace
specific handlers: they can reuse defaults for the rest.

## EngineData Trait

Kernel never assumes data is Arrow. It uses the `EngineData` trait: an opaque columnar data
interface. The kernel extracts data via a visitor pattern (`visit_rows` with typed `GetData`
accessors), not by inspecting columns directly. Never downcast `EngineData` to a concrete type
(e.g. `ArrowEngineData`) in prod kernel code: only engine *implementations* know the concrete
type. (Unit tests using the default engine may legitimately downcast.)

`DefaultEngine` uses `ArrowEngineData` (wrapping Arrow `RecordBatch`). Custom engines implement
`EngineData` for their own columnar format.

Key methods: `visit_rows`, `len`, `append_columns` (for partition value injection/column mapping),
`apply_selection_vector` (for deletion vectors).

**IMPORTANT:** Never assume that reading one file produces exactly one batch. Always iterate over
all returned batches: the engine may split a single file across multiple batches.

## Catalog-Managed Tables

Tables whose commits go through a catalog (e.g. Unity Catalog) instead of direct filesystem
writes. Kernel doesn't know about catalogs: the catalog client provides a log tail via
`SnapshotBuilder::with_log_tail()`, caps the version via `with_max_catalog_version()`, and
uses a custom `Committer` for staging/ratifying/publishing commits.

The `UCCommitter` (in the `delta-kernel-unity-catalog` crate) is the reference implementation of a
catalog committer for Unity Catalog. It writes version 0 directly to `_delta_log/`. For later
versions, it stages commits in `_staged_commits/`, calls the UC commit API to ratify them, and
publishes them by atomically copying them to `_delta_log/`.

For versions after 0, commit types are staged (written to `_staged_commits/`), ratified (accepted
by the catalog for a version), and published (copied to `_delta_log/` as a normal Delta file).
