//! Engine callback framework for opaque-predicate evaluation.
//!
//! Engines pass a [`COpaqueEvalCallbacks`] struct by value to
//! [`crate::expressions::kernel_visitor::visit_predicate_opaque_with_eval`]. Kernel does all
//! recursive evaluation natively through its standard `evaluate_expression` / `evaluate_predicate`
//! paths; the engine is called only for the opaque-predicate node itself, and receives args as
//! pre-computed Arrow arrays.
//!
//! Available only under `default-engine-base`: args and results cross as Arrow C Data Interface
//! batches, and kernel pre-evaluates the args with its Arrow expression evaluator.
//! TODO: support a non-arrow opaque-eval path so engines without the Arrow evaluator can use this.
//!
//! Mirrors how kernel-native opaque ops work (see `OpaqueLessThanOp` in
//! `kernel/src/engine/arrow_expression/tests.rs`): the op gets the raw args, calls
//! `evaluate_expression` on each to produce ArrayRefs, then combines them with op-specific logic.

/// Engine callback for **row-time** evaluation of an opaque predicate.
///
/// Kernel pre-evaluates the predicate's args into a `RecordBatch` (one field per arg) and passes it
/// by value as `args_in` (an `ArrowFFIData`); the engine owns it and must release both Arrow C Data
/// Interface handles on every path (including `Failure`/`Uninit`). The batch's columns line up with
/// the predicate's args by position:
/// - a `Column` arg arrives as its evaluated values
/// - a `Literal` arg as the constant repeated for every row
/// - a `Predicate` arg as a `BooleanArray` of its verdicts
///
/// The engine returns one bool per row.
///
/// The result uses the out-pointer convention: kernel pre-initializes `*out` to
/// `EngineExecResult::Uninit`. On success the engine writes `EngineExecResult::Success` holding the
/// result `BooleanArray` as Arrow C Data Interface structs, transferring their ownership to kernel.
/// On failure it writes `EngineExecResult::Failure` carrying a `FFIKernelError` code and a message
/// handle (built via `allocate_kernel_string`); leaving `*out` as `Uninit` is also treated as an
/// error. When `inverted`, evaluate `NOT op`.
///
/// # Safety
/// `out` is valid only for the duration of the call; the engine must not retain it. The callback
/// must not panic or unwind across the FFI boundary.

/// (`Int64`; null if not collected). `Literal`/`Predicate` args are unchanged. The engine returns
/// one bool per file: `false` = skip, `true`/`null` = keep.

/// Stats are *conservative*: `min`/`max` only bound the values and `nullcount`/`rowcount` may
/// overcount, so skip a file only when the predicate *cannot* hold for any value in `[min, max]`.
/// Keep (`true`/`null`) whenever the stats can't prove the predicate impossible -- in particular
/// on null/absent bounds, where skipping silently drops live files from the scan. Log-replay
/// soundness does not rest on the engine, though: kernel wraps the rewritten predicate with an
/// `OR(NOT is_add, ...)` guard, so Remove rows (which carry null stats) are kept regardless of
/// the verdict and a misbehaving callback cannot resurrect deleted files.
