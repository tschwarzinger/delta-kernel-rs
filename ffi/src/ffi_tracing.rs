//! FFI functions to allow engines to receive log, tracing, and metrics events from kernel.
//!
//! We use a single global tracing subscriber, registered the first time any of
//! [`enable_event_tracing`], [`enable_log_line_tracing`], [`enable_formatted_log_line_tracing`],
//! [`enable_metrics_reporting`], or [`enable_frame_reporting`] is called. The subscriber has
//! independent layers for log events, metric reports, and frame lifecycle events:
//!
//! - The logging layer is a type-erased [`Layer`] that an `enable_*_tracing` call swaps in (either
//!   event-based or formatted log-line)
//! - The metrics slot is a [`ReportGeneratorLayer`] that is `OFF` (zero overhead) until
//!   [`enable_metrics_reporting`] turns it on.
//! - The frame slot is a [`FrameReporterLayer`] that is `OFF` until [`enable_frame_reporting`]
//!   turns it on. Only spans declaring an `enable_call_frame` field are reported.
//!
//! Each layer can be enabled independently. Logging and metrics callbacks can also be replaced.
