# FFI Layer

The `delta_kernel_ffi` crate exposes the kernel to C/C++ via a stable FFI boundary using
cbindgen-generated headers (`.h` and `.hpp`).

## Handle System

Objects crossing the FFI boundary may be wrapped in **handles** -- opaque pointers with
ownership semantics:
- **Exclusive handles** (`mutable=true`, `Box`-like) -- one owner, neither `Copy` nor `Clone`
- **Shared handles** (`Arc`-like) -- shared ownership via reference counting

A handle is needed when a value might outlive the function call that passes it across the
FFI boundary, or when the type is not representable in C/C++ (dyn trait references, slices,
options, etc.). Short-lived "plain old data" types like `ExternResult`, `FFIKernelError`,
`KernelStringSlice`, and `EngineIterator` do not need handles.

Borrowed record arrays use `FfiSlice<T>`: empty slices accept null or non-null pointers, while
non-empty slices require a non-null pointer. The pointed-to storage is never owned.
Descriptive aliases identify each public array's element type.

Every handle has a corresponding `free_*` function (e.g. `free_engine`, `free_snapshot`).

Handle parameters follow one of two ownership contracts:

1. **Borrow:** Rust accesses the handle with `as_ref()` or `as_mut()`. The caller retains
   ownership and remains responsible for passing the handle to its `free_*` function.
2. **Unconditional consume:** Rust calls `into_inner()` before any fallible work. Rust owns the
   value from native entry onward and is responsible for dropping it on every result, including
   errors. The caller must not use or free the handle after the call.

Do not conditionally consume a handle only when a fallible operation succeeds. Every function's
safety documentation must state whether each handle is borrowed or consumed regardless of the
result. For consuming functions, perform string parsing, visitor decoding, validation, and other
fallible work only after all consumed handles have been converted with `into_inner()`.

## Error Handling

Fallible functions return `ExternResult` (tagged union of Ok/Err). The caller provides an
`allocate_error` callback when creating the engine; kernel calls this to allocate errors in
the caller's memory space.

## Read Flow

```
get_default_engine() -> get_snapshot_builder() -> snapshot_builder_build() -> scan() -> scan_metadata() -> read + transform
```

Snapshot builder API (`ffi/src/lib.rs`):
- `get_snapshot_builder(path, engine)` -- fresh snapshot from a table path
- `get_snapshot_builder_from(old_snapshot, engine)` -- incremental update reusing an existing snapshot (avoids re-reading the log)
- `snapshot_builder_with_version(builder, version)` -- optional: pin to a specific version
- `snapshot_builder_with_log_tail(builder, log_tail)` -- optional: set log tail (for catalog-managed tables)
- `snapshot_builder_with_max_catalog_version(builder, version)` -- optional: set max catalog version (for catalog-managed tables)
- `snapshot_builder_with_snapshot_hint(builder, hint)` -- optional: validate and copy a complete
  typed snapshot hint into the builder. Log paths may name published or staged commits, checkpoint
  files, or CRC files; log compaction paths are rejected. Kernel cannot verify that supplied log
  paths belong to the builder's table, so the caller must ensure every path addresses that table.
  A failed call consumes and drops the builder
- `snapshot_builder_build(builder)` -- consume the builder and produce a `SharedSnapshot`
- `free_snapshot_builder(builder)` -- discard without building (e.g. on error paths)

Each `snapshot_builder_with_*` call consumes its input handle and returns the updated handle on
success. The caller must replace the input handle with that result. On error, the builder is
dropped. Snapshot-hint inputs and all nested pointers are borrowed only for the call and copied
into the builder. Cross-component and table validation occurs when the builder is built. The caller
must eventually pass the final returned handle to either `snapshot_builder_build` or
`free_snapshot_builder`.

Snapshot accessors (`ffi/src/lib.rs`) read a built `SharedSnapshot` without I/O -- e.g. `version`,
`snapshot_timestamp`, and `snapshot_file_stats`, which returns `OptionalValue<FfiFileStats>` (scalar
`num_files` / `table_size_bytes` from the CRC; `None` when the snapshot has no CRC, or its CRC lacks
complete file stats). `visit_file_size_histogram` exposes the optional variable-length histogram in
the same file stats: it invokes one callback with borrowed `i64` slices for bin boundaries, file
counts, and total bytes; callers must copy values they retain after the callback.

Domain-metadata reads live in `ffi/src/domain_metadata.rs`: `get_domain_metadata` /
`visit_domain_metadata` for user domains, and `visit_clustering_columns`, which reports one
descriptor per clustering column -- logical name, physical name (what per-file stats are keyed on),
and a type tag -- without exposing the guarded `delta.*` domain JSON directly. It returns
`OptionalValue<usize>`: `None` means not clustered, `Some(0)` means clustered on no columns. The
type tag reuses the `visit_expression_literal_null` encoding, with 255 for types that don't fit a
compact tag (struct, array, map, variant, void, and geometry/geography).

## Commit Range Flow

A `CommitRange` describes a contiguous range of a table's commits. Build one via the commit range
builder (`ffi/src/commit_range.rs`):

```
commit_range_builder_for(path, start_version, engine)
  -> builder = commit_range_builder_with_end_version(builder, end_version) // optional
  -> builder = commit_range_builder_with_log_tail(builder, log_tail, max)  // optional
  -> builder = commit_range_builder_with_max_catalog_version(builder, max) // optional
  -> commit_range_builder_build(builder)                         // -> SharedCommitRange, always consume builder
  -> commit_range_commits(range, engine, actions, actions_len)   // -> SharedCommitActionsIterator
       // or commit_range_commits_with_snapshot(range, engine, start_snapshot, actions, actions_len)
  -> commit_range_commits_next(iter, ctx, visitor)               // visitor receives a SharedCommitAction
       // in the visitor: commit_action_version / commit_action_timestamp
       //                  commit_action_get_actions(action, engine) -> ExclusiveFileReadResultIterator
       //                    -> read_result_next(...) -> free_read_result_iter(...)
```

Each `commit_range_builder_with_*` call consumes its input handle and returns the updated handle on
success; on error, it drops the builder. The caller must pass the final returned handle to either
`commit_range_builder_build` or `free_commit_range_builder`. Release the range with
`free_commit_range` and the commits iterator with `free_commit_actions_iter`. Each
`SharedCommitAction` handed to the visitor must be released with `free_commit_action`.

## Incremental Scan Flow

An incremental scan streams the file-action diff between a base version and a target snapshot
(`ffi/src/incremental_scan.rs`):

```
snapshot_incremental_scan_builder(snapshot, base_version, engine)
  -> incremental_scan_builder_with_predicate(builder, engine, predicate)  // optional; prunes live Adds
  -> incremental_scan_builder_build(builder)      // -> OptionalValue<stream>; None => full-scan fallback
  -> incremental_scan_stream_next_arrow(stream)*  // optional: pull live-Add batches as Arrow
  -> incremental_scan_stream_into_summary(stream) // live-Add / Remove key sets; consumes the stream
```

The module-level docs in `incremental_scan.rs` are the source of truth for the error contract
(any `next_arrow` error kills the stream), the `OptionalValue::None` full-scan-fallback signal,
the pass-through-field version caveat (kernel issue #2552), and handle release. The Arrow batch
reuses `ScanMetadataArrowResult` with null `transforms`.

## Write Flow

```
get_default_engine() -> transaction() -> with_engine_info() -> with_operation() -> add_files() -> commit()
                                                                                  |
                                                                                  v
              committed_transaction_version / committed_transaction_post_commit_snapshot
                                                                                  |
                                                                                  v
                                                                  free_committed_transaction
```

`commit()` and `create_table_commit()` return a `Handle<ExclusiveCommittedTransaction>` that the caller can read via `committed_transaction_version` and `committed_transaction_post_commit_snapshot`, then must release with `free_committed_transaction`. The post-commit snapshot, when present, is a separate `SharedSnapshot` handle that must be freed with `free_snapshot`.

Write context: `get_unpartitioned_write_context` covers unpartitioned tables. For partitioned tables, build a `PartitionValueMap` (`partition_value_map_new` + the typed `partition_value_map_insert_*` functions, one entry per partition column keyed by logical name) and pass it to `get_partitioned_write_context` (consumes the map). Then use `get_write_dir` for the partition's target directory (Hive-style prefix or random prefix), `visit_partition_values` to read the physical `partitionValues` to record in each Add action, and `resolve_file_path` to turn a written file's URL into its relative `add.path`. The `create_table_*` variants apply the same flow to a create-table transaction whose partition columns were declared with `create_table_builder_with_partition_columns`.

Catalog-managed publish flow (after a catalog committer stages commits):

```
committed_transaction_post_commit_snapshot()
  -> snapshot_publish_with_committer(snapshot, committer, engine)
     // borrows snapshot; consumes committer (do not free)
  -> use returned snapshot for subsequent transaction_with_committer / checkpoint
     // mint a fresh get_uc_committer for that transaction -- it also consumes
  -> free_snapshot (returned snapshot) when done
  -> free_snapshot (post-commit input snapshot)
```

`snapshot_publish_with_committer` mirrors kernel `Snapshot::publish`: it copies ratified staged
commits into `_delta_log/` via the catalog committer's `publish()` implementation. The input
snapshot is borrowed; the committer is consumed (do not free). The caller owns the returned
snapshot handle. The returned snapshot carries the published watermark (`max_published_version`)
needed for the next catalog commit; do not continue from the pre-publish post-commit snapshot.

Column defaults (`allowColumnDefaults`) live in `ffi/src/column_default.rs`. The kernel reports
defaults but never materializes them, so the connector fills every omitted column itself:

```
transaction()
  -> transaction_visit_top_level_column_defaults(txn, engine, ctx, visitor)
  -> transaction_ack_column_defaults(txn)   // REQUIRED, else the write context errors with
                                            // FFIKernelError::InvalidTransactionStateError
  -> get_unpartitioned_write_context(txn, engine) ... add_files ... commit
```

Deletion vector update flow:

```
transaction()
  -> dv_descriptor_map_new()
  -> dv_descriptor_new()
  -> dv_descriptor_map_insert()
  -> scan() -> scan_metadata_iter_init()
  -> transaction_update_deletion_vectors()
  -> commit()
```

The engine authors the DV file and passes descriptor fields to `dv_descriptor_new`. The
descriptor map and scan iterator are both consumed by `transaction_update_deletion_vectors`;
descriptor handles are consumed by `dv_descriptor_map_insert` regardless of the result. DV
updates require both the `deletionVectors` reader/writer feature and
`delta.enableDeletionVectors=true`.

For distributed writes, `transaction_write_state` returns an owned state handle that outlives the
transaction. `write_state_encode` returns opaque bytes to copy to workers. Decode them once on each
worker with `write_state_decode`. Local writers can skip this round trip.
Create-table writes use the `create_table_get_*_write_context` functions and do not expose
transportable write state.
Create a builder for each output partition with `write_context_builder`. Partitioned writers set
values keyed by logical names with `write_context_builder_with_partition_values` or exact physical
names with `write_context_builder_with_physical_partition_values`; writers that provide materialized
row-tracking columns also call `write_context_builder_with_row_tracking_columns`. Finish with
`write_context_builder_build`. Builders and bound contexts hold their own state reference, so they
remain valid after `free_write_state`. Drop an unused builder with `free_write_context_builder` and
a bound context with `free_write_context`. Driver and workers must use the same kernel version.
`get_write_state_stats_columns` passes every physical statistics column path to one allocation
callback as a borrowed `FfiSlice<FfiColumnName>`. `snapshot_physical_schema` returns the full
physical table schema, which may contain fields that are not stored in data files.

## Tracing & Metrics

Gated behind the `tracing` feature. A single global `tracing` subscriber backs logging, metrics,
and frame lifecycle reporting; it is installed lazily the first time any `enable_*` function below
is called. The subscriber has three reloadable slots: a logging layer (swapped wholesale between
event-based and log-line formats), a metrics layer (a fixed `ReportGeneratorLayer` toggled on/off
via a reloadable level filter), and a frame layer (a fixed `FrameReporterLayer` toggled on/off via
a reloadable level filter).

Logging registration (each re-callable to replace the active callback, format, and level):
- `enable_event_tracing(callback, max_level)` -- structured `Event`s; the engine formats them
- `enable_log_line_tracing(callback, max_level)` -- pre-formatted log lines, default options
- `enable_formatted_log_line_tracing(callback, max_level, format, ansi, with_time, with_level, with_target)`
  -- pre-formatted log lines with explicit formatting options

Metrics registration:
- `enable_metrics_reporting(callback)` -- forwards each kernel `MetricEvent` to the callback as a
  `repr(C)` `MetricEvent` (see `src/ffi_metrics.rs`). Re-calling replaces the callback.

Frame lifecycle registration:
- `enable_frame_reporting(callback)` -- forwards OPEN/CLOSE for each dynamic activation of a span
  declaring the static `enable_call_frame` field. The callback runs synchronously on the entering
  or exiting thread and receives a tagged `FrameEvent` union. OPEN includes the span id and a
  borrowed UTF-8 name; CLOSE includes the matching id. Calls may overlap across threads; callback
  state must be thread-safe, and profile consumers must maintain a separate event stack for each
  callback thread. Registration is one-shot so a callback cannot be replaced between a span's OPEN
  and CLOSE events; another call fails and leaves the existing callback active.

The `MetricEvent` and any `KernelStringSlice` it carries are only valid for the duration of the
callback. Durations are `u64`, suffixed `_ns` (nanoseconds) or `_ms` (milliseconds). Operation ids
are the raw 16 bytes of the kernel UUID (`MetricId`).

## Building

```bash
cargo build -p delta_kernel_ffi --release
# Headers written to target/ffi-headers/
```

Feature flags:
- `default-engine-rustls` (default)
- `default-engine-native-tls`
- `arrow` (default; currently maps to `arrow-60`)
- `arrow-60`, `arrow-59`
- `delta-kernel-unity-catalog`
- `tracing`
- `alloc-tracking` -- installs `peak_alloc` as the tracking global allocator; enables meaningful
  `*_native_bytes` / `alloc_tracking_enabled` getters (cdylib only; conflicts with
  another `#[global_allocator]` if linked as an rlib)

## Testing under Miri

CI runs this crate's tests under Miri (the `miri` job in `build.yml`) to catch undefined
behavior in the `unsafe` FFI boundary: raw-pointer reads/writes, `unsafe impl Send/Sync`,
`Handle` conversions (`as_ref` / `clone_as_arc` / `into_inner`), and `free_*`. Miri is a MIR
interpreter, so it runs 10x-100x slower than native and is billed by the interpreted
instruction, not wall-clock work.

The consequence: a test is expensive under Miri in proportion to how much *code it executes*,
not how much it asserts. Tests that construct heavyweight but **safe** machinery -- a
reqwest/rustls client (crypto init), a multi-threaded tokio runtime, an Arrow/parquet write --
cost minutes under the interpreter while exercising none of our `unsafe`. That time buys no
UB detection.

Guidance for adding or triaging FFI tests:

- **Keep under Miri** any test that executes `unsafe` whose correctness Miri can check. This is
  the reason the job exists; do not skip these for speed.
- **Never add new `unsafe` to a Miri-ignored test.** An ignored test is invisible to Miri, so
  `unsafe` introduced in one is never checked for undefined behavior, and nothing in CI reports
  the gap. When a change needs new `unsafe` in an ignored test, either exercise that `unsafe`
  from a test that runs under Miri, or un-skip the test.
- **`#[cfg_attr(miri, ignore)]` is legitimate for two reasons, and only these two:**
  1. Miri cannot run it (e.g. an unsupported foreign function). Before accepting this, check
     whether the blocker is avoidable: local-filesystem storage reaches `std::fs::hard_link`
     (`linkat`), which Miri rejects, but in-memory storage does not. Prefer an in-memory store.
  2. The test executes no `unsafe`, OR only `unsafe` that a kept test already covers, AND it is
     expensive under Miri. Skip only with the coverage argument; skipping for cost alone drops
     UB coverage.
- When you skip under reason 2, **prove the coverage is preserved**: the kept tests' set of
  `unsafe` FFI functions must be a superset of the skipped test's. Name the covering test in the
  `ignore` reason or a nearby comment so a future reader can re-check it.
- Miri's leak check also flags handles a test itself forgot to free. Triage before assuming a bug
  in the code under test: a missing `free_*` in the test is a test fix, while an unjoined
  background thread at teardown can be an artifact of how the test ends.
- Prefer picking the **cheapest** test that crosses a given `unsafe` path over keeping several
  that cross the same path with more safe work each.
- `rest_engine` and the checkpoint tests in `lib.rs` document worked examples of this split.
- `-Zmiri-provenance-gc=1000000` on the Miri step is a pure speed knob (GC frequency) and does
  not weaken detection. Do NOT add `-Zmiri-disable-stacked-borrows`, `-disable-validation`,
  `-disable-data-race-detector`, or `-Zmiri-preemption-rate=0`: the first three are unsound, and
  the last reduces data-race schedule exploration.
