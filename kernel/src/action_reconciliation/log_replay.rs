//! The [`ActionReconciliationProcessor`] implements specialized log replay logic for performing
//! action reconciliation. It processes log files in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest)
//! and selects the set of actions to be included.
//!
//! Uses cases include checkpointing and log compaction.
//!
//! ## Actions Included
//!
//! This processor applies several filtering and deduplication steps to each batch of log actions:
//!
//! 1. **Protocol and Metadata**: Retains exactly one of each - keeping only the latest protocol and
//!    metadata actions.
//! 2. **Txn Actions**: Keeps exactly one `txn` action for each unique app ID, always selecting the
//!    latest one encountered.
//! 3. **File Actions**: Resolves file actions to produce the latest state of the table, keeping the
//!    most recent valid add actions and unexpired remove actions (tombstones) that are newer than
//!    `minimum_file_retention_timestamp`.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - [`ActionReconciliationVisitor`]: Implements [`RowVisitor`] to examine each action in a batch
//!   and determine if it should be included. It maintains state for deduplication across multiple
//!   actions in a batch and efficiently handles all filtering rules.
//!
//! - [`ActionReconciliationProcessor`]: Implements the [`LogReplayProcessor`] trait and
//!   orchestrates the overall process. For each batch of log actions, it:
//!   1. Creates a visitor with the current deduplication state
//!   2. Applies the visitor to filter actions in the batch
//!   3. Tracks state for deduplication across batches
//!   4. Produces a [`ActionReconciliationBatch`] result which includes both the filtered data and
//!      counts of actions selected
