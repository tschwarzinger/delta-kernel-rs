//! This module provides log replay utilities.
//!
//! Log replay is the process of transforming an iterator of action batches (read from Delta
//! transaction logs) into an iterator of filtered/transformed actions for specific use cases.
//! The logs, which record all table changes as JSON entries, are processed batch by batch,
//! typically from newest to oldest.
//!
//! Log replay is currently implemented for table scans, which filter and apply transformations
//! to produce file actions which builds the view of the table state at a specific point in time.
//! Future extensions will support additional log replay processors beyond the current use case.
//! (e.g. checkpointing: filter actions to include only those needed to rebuild table state)
//!
//! This module provides structures for efficient batch processing, focusing on file action
//! deduplication with `FileActionDeduplicator` which tracks unique files across log batches
//! to minimize memory usage for tables with extensive history.

/// A trait for processing batches of actions from Delta transaction logs during log replay.
///
/// Log replay processors scan transaction logs in **reverse chronological order** (newest to
/// oldest), filtering and transforming action batches into specialized output types. These
/// processors:
///
/// - **Track and deduplicate file actions** to apply appropriate `Remove` actions to corresponding
///   `Add` actions (and omit the file from the log replay output)
/// - **Maintain selection vectors** to indicate which actions in each batch should be included.
/// - **Apply custom filtering logic** based on the processor’s purpose (e.g., checkpointing,
///   scanning).
/// - **Data skipping** filters are applied to the initial selection vector to reduce the number of
///   rows processed by the processor, (if a filter is provided).
///
/// # Implementations
///
/// - [`ScanLogReplayProcessor`]: Used for table scans, this processor filters and selects
///   deduplicated `Add` actions from log batches to reconstruct the view of the table at a specific
///   point in time. Note that scans do not expose `Remove` actions. Data skipping may be applied
///   when a predicate is provided.
///
/// - [`ActionReconciliationProcessor`]: Used for action reconciliation (including checkpoint
///   writing), this processor filters and selects actions from log batches for inclusion in V1 spec
///   checkpoint files. Unlike scans, action reconciliation processing includes additional actions,
///   such as `Remove`, `Metadata`, and `Protocol`, required to fully reconstruct table state. Data
///   skipping is not applied during action reconciliation processing.
///
/// [`ActionReconciliationProcessor`]: crate::action_reconciliation::log_replay::ActionReconciliationProcessor
///
/// # Action Iterator Input
///
/// The [`LogReplayProcessor::process_actions_iter`] method is the entry point for log replay
/// processing. It takes as input an iterator of (actions batch, is_commit_batch flag) tuples and
/// returns an iterator of processor-specific output types with selection vectors. The
/// is_commit_batch bool flag in each tuple indicates whether the batch came from a commit log
/// (`true`) or checkpoint (`false`). Action batches **must** be sorted by the order of the actions
/// in the log from most recent to oldest.
///
/// Each row that is selected in the returned output **must** be included in the processor's result
/// (e.g., in scan results or checkpoint files), while non-selected rows **must** be ignored.
///
/// # Output Types
///
/// The [`LogReplayProcessor::Output`] type represents the material result of log replay, and it
/// must implement the [`HasSelectionVector`] trait to allow filtering of irrelevant rows:
///
/// - For **scans**, the output type is [`ScanMetadata`], which contains the file actions (`Add`
///   actions) that need to be applied to build the table's view, accompanied by a **selection
///   vector** that identifies which rows should be included. A transform vector may also be
///   included to handle schema changes, such as renaming columns or modifying data types.
///
/// - For **checkpoints**, the output type is [`FilteredEngineData`], which includes the actions
///   necessary to write to the checkpoint file (`Add`, `Remove`, `Metadata`, `Protocol` actions),
///   filtered by the **selection vector** to determine which rows are included in the final
///   checkpoint.
