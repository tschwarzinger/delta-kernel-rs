//! Builder for ALTER TABLE (schema evolution) transactions.
//!
//! This module contains [`AlterTableTransactionBuilder`], which uses a type-state pattern to
//! enforce valid operation chaining at compile time.
//!
//! # Type States
//!
//! - [`Ready`]: Initial state. Operations are available, but `build()` is not (at least one
//!   operation is required).
//! - [`Modifying`]: After any chainable schema operation. More ops can be chained, and `build()` is
//!   available. See [`AlterTableTransactionBuilder<Modifying>`] for ops.
//!
//! # Transitions
//!
//! Each `impl` block below is gated by a state bound and documents which operations that
//! state enables. Chainable schema operations live on `impl<S: Chainable>` and transition
//! the builder to a chainable state; `build()` lives on states that are buildable.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Allowed: at least one op queued before build().
//! snapshot.alter_table().add_column(field).build(engine, committer)?;
//!
//! // Not allowed: build() is not defined on Ready (no ops queued).
//! snapshot.alter_table().build(engine, committer)?;  // compile error
//! ```
