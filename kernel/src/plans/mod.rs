//! Declarative plans: the kernel describes data work as a relational plan; the engine executes it.
//!
//! Kernel does no I/O or data processing itself. When an operation needs data work, kernel builds a
//! plan and hands it to the engine's [`PlanExecutor`], which compiles it into the engine's own
//! representation (a Spark or DataFusion logical plan, an iterator pipeline) and runs it. The
//! engine therefore applies its own optimizer, parallelism, and async I/O to all of kernel's data
//! work, not just leaf scans.
//!
//! # What a plan is
//!
//! A [`Plan`] is a DAG of relational operators ([`Operator`](ir::nodes::Operator)):
//! sources, transforms, and set combinators. Most map one-to-one onto a SQL operator, so a plan
//! reads like a query. The live-add metadata plan built in `scan::scan_plan`, for example, is
//! roughly:
//!
//! ```sql
//! -- commits: keep the newest action per file, then keep only the live adds
//! SELECT add FROM (
//!     SELECT max_by(action, version) AS add FROM commits GROUP BY file_key
//! ) WHERE add IS NOT NULL
//! UNION ALL
//! -- checkpoint adds that no newer commit superseded
//! SELECT c.add FROM checkpoint c
//! LEFT ANTI JOIN commit_keys k ON c.file_key = k.file_key
//! ```
//!
//! # Writing an executor
//!
//! An executor implements [`PlanExecutor::execute_op`], dispatching on the [`Operation`] it
//! receives and returning the matching [`PlanResult`] variant:
//!
//! - [`Operation::IoOperation`] is a single I/O request; each [`IoOperation`] variant documents the
//!   [`PlanResult`] it must return.
//! - [`Operation::QueryPlan`] is a [`Plan`], returning [`PlanResult::Data`]. Either evaluate
//!   [`Plan::nodes`](ir::plan::Plan::nodes) in slice order, which is topologically sorted so a
//!   node's inputs are already evaluated, or compile the DAG into the engine's own plan.
//!
//! Every operator, expression, and predicate a plan contains must be handled; returning an error
//! for an unsupported one is fine, and kernel surfaces it to the caller. The sync engine's
//! `SyncPlanExecutor` is a complete reference implementation.
//!
//! # Consuming terminal results
//!
//! [`PlanExecutor::execute_op`] and [`PlanResult::Data`] provide the generic result contract for
//! operations whose output is consumed by kernel.
//!
//! Some kernel APIs instead return a [`Plan`] whose terminal rows belong to the
//! connector. The connector may execute the plan through its ordinary query engine and keep the
//! result in the engine's native representation instead of adapting it through [`EngineData`] only
//! to pass it back to itself. [`Scan::declarative_metadata_scan_plan`] is one example: the
//! connector may consume the live `add` rows from the returned plan itself.
//!
//! Connectors should use this native path when they own the result and adapting it through
//! [`EngineData`] adds no semantic value. The native path must preserve the plan's relational
//! semantics and declared output schema. Schema validation, streaming behavior, error propagation,
//! and cancellation must work the same way as they do on the generic path.
//!
//! The generic [`PlanExecutor`] path remains required for operations whose results kernel consumes.
//!
//! [`Scan::declarative_metadata_scan_plan`]: crate::scan::Scan::declarative_metadata_scan_plan
//!
//! # Where to look
//!
//! - [`PlanBuilder`] builds plans through a fluent, schema-validating API, each method documenting
//!   its operator with a runnable example.
//! - [`ir::nodes`] is the operator catalog: each [`Operator`](ir::nodes::Operator) variant's
//!   payload struct carries its semantics, invariants, and worked examples.
//! - [`crate::expressions`] defines the expressions and predicates operators evaluate, including
//!   the type and null semantics an executor must match.
//!
//! This module is opt-in behind the `declarative-plans` feature flag.
