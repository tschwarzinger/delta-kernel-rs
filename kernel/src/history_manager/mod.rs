//! This module provides functions for performing timestamp queries over the Delta Log, translating
//! between timestamps and Delta versions.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Use this module to:
//! - Convert timestamps or timestamp ranges into Delta versions or version ranges
//! - Perform time travel queries
//! - Execute timestamp-based change data feed queries
//!
//! The history_manager module works with tables regardless of whether they have In-Commit
//! Timestamps (ICT) enabled. ICT is a Delta table feature that stores precise commit timestamps
//! in the commit metadata rather than relying on file modification times, which can be affected
//! by clock skew or filesystem limitations.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! All timestamp queries are limited to the state captured in the provided [`Snapshot`]. For
//! tables without ICT enabled, timestamp queries rely on file modification timestamps, which are
//! not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing across commits.
