/// Executes kernel declarative plans on DataFusion.
///
/// Holds two handles, each owning a distinct part of the work:
/// - `session_ctx` -- *plan it, then run it*: DataFusion's `SessionContext` is the front door to
///   the query engine. It holds the session-scoped state needed to turn a query into something
///   runnable: configuration, registered tables/catalogs and functions, the logical/physical
///   optimizer rules, and a handle to the shared runtime environment (memory pool, object-store
///   registry). We use it to compile and optimize a kernel plan into a DataFusion `LogicalPlan`,
///   then lower it to a physical `ExecutionPlan`. It is heavyweight and meant to be long-lived and
///   shared. At execution time we derive a fresh per-run `TaskContext` from it via
///   `session_ctx.task_ctx()` and pass that to `ExecutionPlan::execute`.
/// - `storage_handler` -- *fetch the bytes the query engine can't*: a kernel [`StorageHandler`] for
///   the storage I/O DataFusion cannot do itself (deletion-vector resolution, footer reads,
///   listing). This is the file-system subset of a kernel [`Engine`](delta_kernel::Engine) -- the
///   executor needs nothing else from the engine, so it holds only this.
